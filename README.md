# hackers-site

Hi there! This is the website for the Colby Hackers. The site is built on Jekyll, a platform that makes it easy to maintain blog-like websites. The theme I ([Tyler Hansen](https://github.com/tylermhansen)) am using to create the site is called Agency, and it was originally a BootStrap theme. Agency is licensed under the MIT License.  

## How to contribute

1. Clone this repository
2. Create Markdown files in /_posts (following the same format as the ones that exist there already, of course) to post news updates pertinent to club operations.
3. Edit the HTML and CSS files in /_includes as necessary.
4. Upload images to be used on the site in /img in the proper subfolder.
5. Make changes in _config.yml as needed.
