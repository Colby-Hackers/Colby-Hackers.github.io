description: On Wednesday, 09/11/2019, we convened for our first meeting of the 2019-2020 Academic Year. To nobody's surprise, it was time for the club to regain some structure (thank you Maan Qraitem for gathering us to make this happen). It was decided that leadership positions must be filled and upheld to facilitate smoother transition of club responsibilities as folks graduate and help it stand the test of time. Elections were held, and the results are as follows; Ethan Seal and Sawyer Strong will serve as Co-Presidents for the year, Tyler Hansen will be the Publicity Chair, Iris Liu will be Treasurer, and Henry Pacheco will be the Secretary. I am looking forward to a fantastic year full of hackathons and other fun CS events! Updates will be regularly posted here on the site. - Tyler
