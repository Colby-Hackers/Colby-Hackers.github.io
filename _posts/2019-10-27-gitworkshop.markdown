Git is the standard for collaboration on software projects, and most companies will appreciate a potential employee having some experience with it. At the workshop, you'll learn the core functionalities of Git and gain the tools necessary to create a portfolio on GitHub so that future employers can see all of the cool projects you've worked on. Please join us and don't miss out on an awesome chance to develop some very important skills! Use  this google form - https://forms.gle/AoR5wpeGjaiQ3eA66 - to RSVP. See you there! - Tyler
